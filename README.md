# Dodge
This game is to simply control a character with arrow keys, trying to dodge bullets.

# Motivation for game
A bunch of different reasons:
- Interested in making a simple game
- Not only making a game, but a web app.
- This is to show off **React, Redux and Javascript skills**
- Not too complicated of a game, but it's a "bullet hell game" genre which is fun for a lot of people.
